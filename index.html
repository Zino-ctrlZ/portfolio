							Moved to Missouri to study Computer Science where I graduated
							Magna Cum Laude. <br />
							<br />
							Initially had no idea where the state was on the map but I knew
							Truman was ranked the number one public school in the midwest and
							offered a great scholarship program. I was determined to get that
							degree and Truman was great place to get it!

							Worked as a social media manager and web developer at Truman State
							University's Center for Diversity and Inclusion.<br /><br />
							I founded a support group by collaborating with leaders of the
							different sudent organizations, particularly pertaining to
							different cultures to improve overall participation and turnout at
							their individual events. I also created design plans in
							collaboration with CDI director to revamp the CDI website before
							graduating.

							Interned at <a href="">CSC Corptax</a> learning .Net & C#. <br />

							Founded a volunteer organization called
							<a href="">Coder Party</a>. <br /><br />Formed to help prepare
							students for life after college. I would talk to recruiters in the
							tech industry, senior sofware engineers and managers at places
							like Google, Adobe, and Snapchat for insight on how to land those
							entry level jobs when one doesn't come from a top rated school. I
							would also run lessons on technical questions for job interviews
							for my fellow students. Teaching others improved my own skills and
							landed me my first full time job. The work at Coder Party helped
							75% of the participants land their first internships!

							Developed a trading program using python.<br /><br />Building on
							top of the robin stocks python package, I developed a python
							script that retrieves and organizes data pertaining to a Robinhood
							account. This script also provides functions which can be used to
							improve options trading. For example, a function that finds the
							best hedge of an option position based on certain criteria passed
							to the function like the option delta.
